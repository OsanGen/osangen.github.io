# Component/script: `scripts/validate-content.ts`

Purpose:
- Enforce data integrity and link hygiene across all JSON-backed content collections.

Inputs:
- Content loaders from `src/lib/content.ts`:
  - GPTs, games, modules, workshops, posts, profile, communities, booking
- Shared link helpers from `src/lib/link-utils.ts`.

Outputs:
- Exit code `0` with `Content validation passed.` when no violations exist.
- Exit code `1` with explicit issue list when violations are found.

State:
- No persisted state.
- Validation-only execution path.

Edge cases:
- Placeholder links are rejected where links are provided.
- Duplicate IDs are flagged case-insensitively.
- Optional booking links are validated only when present.

Dependencies:
- `tsx` runtime via npm script.
- Runtime schemas/loaders in `src/lib/content.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- All required link fields are canonical and non-placeholder.
- All collection IDs are unique.
- Minimum GPT inventory threshold remains enforced.
- Calendly URL checks are handled by a deduplicated entry loop.
