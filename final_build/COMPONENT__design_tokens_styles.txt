Component: Visual token system (`src/styles/tokens.css`) + global style layer (`src/styles/global.css`)

Purpose:
- Define the canonical design tokens for CogSec Pastel (fields, ink, fog, and the four accents) and expose them as CSS variables.
- Apply those tokens consistently across global component styles so page chrome is low-noise, monochrome-field with accent as secondary treatment.

Inputs:
- Runtime CSS variable values declared in `:root`.
- Theme usage from page-level `.scene-accent` overrides and global consumers in `src/styles/global.css`.

Outputs:
- Stable, deterministic visual tokens for all components.
- Global component styles that rely on tokenized values for backgrounds, borders, shadows, and typography states.

State:
- CSS custom properties stored on `:root` in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
- Derived property: `--accent` defaults to `var(--cog-blue)` unless a scene-level override sets `--scene-accent`.
- Active design-surface vocabulary: `--surface`, `--panel`, `--stroke`, `--shadow`.

Edge cases:
- Legacy surface variants (`surface-panel`, `surface-soft`, `surface-dim`, `panel-strong`, `fog-subtle`) are intentionally removed from active usage.
- Non-essential decorative gradients and non-token hardcoded colors in global stylesheet are replaced by panel/surface token usage.
- Any future page-specific accent override should still use one of the four canonical accents.

Dependencies:
- Tokens consumed by all pages through global imports in base layout.
- Page-level accent intent controlled by `--scene-accent` declarations on scene containers.

Acceptance checks:
- `src/styles/tokens.css` has only one active accent set for each required tone and `--accent: var(--cog-blue)`.
- `src/styles/global.css` contains no hardcoded accent-color hex literals except token definitions.
- Legacy extra surface variants are absent from active style usage.
- Decorative gradients are limited to non-essential utility; no mandatory brand-mark hardcoded yellow shadow or non-token panel tinting remains.
