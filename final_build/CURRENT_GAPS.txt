# CURRENT_GAPS
- executive evidence motion layer | completed | Added `motion`-powered OSAN-safe reveal + progress-rail system via `MotionEnhance` + `osan-motion.ts`, gated to `/`, `/workshops*`, and `/gpts*` by `data-page`.
- motion runtime verification | completed | Ran `npm run check`, `npm run validate:content`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:dist`, and `npm run verify:runtime` after motion integration.
- motion visual QA pass | pending | Run manual browser pass on desktop/mobile for `/`, `/workshops`, `/gpts`, and verify reduced-motion behavior disables enhancement.
- runtime HTTP route smoke automation | completed | Added `scripts/runtime-http-smoke.mjs` plus `npm run verify:runtime` to enforce 200 responses for core static and representative dynamic routes via local `astro preview`.
- gpt placeholder warning dedupe | completed | `loadGPTs()` now logs placeholder CTA warning once per process to reduce duplicate build/check log noise.
- footer/nav join-language parity | completed | Updated footer link label from `Join` to `Contribute` to match header/home contribution terminology.
- workshop detail CTA precedence hardening | completed | Unified `/workshops/[id]` CTA selection so label/href stay in sync (`Replay` -> `Slides` -> `Open details`) and placeholder links cannot produce incorrect labels.
- game embed duplicate listener guard | completed | Added per-node initialization guard in `GameEmbed` inline script and removed unused randomized iframe id to reduce redundant DOM listeners on repeated embeds.
- join funnel contribution reframing | completed | Updated `/join`, homepage route card, header nav, and related route copy to use contribution language while keeping `/join` path compatibility.
- route accent consistency cleanup | completed | Removed hardcoded inline `--scene-accent`/`scene-accent` overrides from index, /gpts, /gpts/[id], /join, and /labs; GPTCard now defaults to route-scoped `var(--scene-accent)` for route-consistent accents.
- homepage route-card visual simplification | completed | Removed decorative route-grid/route-card rail and dot motifs and switched homepage route CTAs to `button--ghost` for cleaner proof-first cards.
- learn route split | completed | Added dedicated `/visual-classes` page, extracted shared `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`, and made `/workshops` workshops-only.
- astro5 migration completion | completed | Upgraded `astro` to `5.17.2`, upgraded `@astrojs/check` to `0.9.6`, added explicit `src/content.config.ts`, and verified `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- visual-pass for global shell effects | pending | Validate accent and motion behavior at /, /labs, /workshops, /gpts, and /resume on desktop/mobile, including new bubble motif visibility.
- motion parser hardening | completed | Replaced fragile numeric parsing in `src/scripts/osan-motion.ts` with null-safe token parsing and removed `as any` casts while preserving reveal timing behavior.
- global bubble motif rollout | completed | Added centralized route-tinted bubble system across hero shells, first major non-hero content surfaces, and subtle page-frame fallback.
- service-worker deployment verification | pending | Deploy build and run a smoke check on a throttled/offline path.
- lab embed performance optimization | pending | Verify GameEmbed click-to-load behavior and fallback on a real iframe URL.
- manual runtime smoke pass | pending | Automated HTTP 200 checks now run via `npm run verify:runtime`; remaining interactive browser checks are external/inactive link click paths, GameEmbed blocked-iframe fallback, and service worker offline behavior.
- labs card accent rail removal | completed | Removed Labs listing card pseudo-element rail via `src/styles/pages/labs.css` to eliminate edge line noise and improve heading readability.
- line-review ledger initialization | completed | Added `final_build/LINE_REVIEW_LEDGER.txt` with reviewed status for every file in `src`, `scripts`, `public`, and `docs`, plus explicit dead-code removal entry for `src/components/TwoOptionCTA.astro`.
- release-B dead component cleanup | completed | Removed unreferenced `src/components/TwoOptionCTA.astro` after repository-wide reference check.
- dist integrity automation | completed | Added `scripts/check-dist-integrity.mjs` and npm script `verify:dist` for sitemap parity, internal link integrity, and dynamic route output checks.
- workshop route policy smoke | completed | Verified by build output: only `/workshops/leanagents-workshop-chatgpt-apps` and `/workshops/manus-workshop` are generated; `/workshops/ghost-machine` is not generated.
- production deploy | completed | Pushed commit `0d74eef853a8246af510f87155c556e01a41f5a8` to `main`; workflows `CI` (`22042398300`) and `Deploy Astro site to GitHub Pages` (`22042398323`) completed successfully.
- /join landing refactor | completed | Replaced legacy community catalog /join implementation with the quarter internship landing and added `src/content/data/join_project.json`.
- /join signup CTA activation | completed | Added live signup URL (`https://genmrkt.lovable.app/`) with a primary CTA button and explicit new-tab behavior.
- /join single-cta visual cleanup | completed | Simplified /join hero actions to a single application CTA, removed in-hero `AI-assisted; reviewed by humans; results vary.` copy, and tightened spacing/typography for a cleaner layout.
- labs nav tab label update | completed | Renamed Labs tab label in header to “OSAN GAMES”.
- homepage lab card rename | completed | Reworded homepage labs route card and hero CTA to “OSAN GAMES”.
- footer secondary nav rename | completed | Updated footer /labs label from “Educational Games” to “OSAN GAMES”.
- labs page hero heading rename | completed | Updated `/labs` page title and hero heading to `OSAN GAMES`.
- labs card pill cleanup | completed | Removed Labs listing concept tags and `PLAYABLE` badge in `/labs` cards and tightened Labs-only card rhythm via `src/styles/pages/labs.css`.
- labs hero-card spacing separation | completed | Added Labs-only `32px` (`var(--space-5)`) spacing between `.labs-hero` and first catalog grid block via `.labs-hero + .labs-catalog-grid`.
- learn split QA pass | pending | Run manual browser smoke on `/workshops` and `/visual-classes`, and verify route links from header/footer/index/more/home are all discoverable and one-accent safe.
