# CURRENT_GAPS
- osan header brand icon refresh | completed | Replaced `/icons/oscar-cog-brain.svg` with a flat 2D yellow brain SVG and removed header square/chassis chrome via `.brand-mark` styling.
- osan header brand icon polish | completed | Completed brand-lockup clean-up for OSAN 2D appearance: removed mark rounding and added block-level lockup rendering plus neutral highlight tint on the brain proof line.
- live deploy trigger | completed | Pushed commit `a8d8a1606dfd8f6077bc0f3052f9f3a1549240ca` to `main`; push-based deployment pipeline triggered successfully.
- deploy run monitoring | pending | Wait for CI run `22335360949` and Deploy run `22335360946` to complete, then confirm the live site reflects this commit.
- executive evidence motion layer | completed | Added `motion`-powered OSAN-safe reveal + progress-rail system via `MotionEnhance` + `osan-motion.ts`, gated to `/`, `/workshops*`, and `/gpts*` by `data-page`.
- motion runtime verification | completed | Ran `npm run check`, `npm run validate:content`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:dist`, and `npm run verify:runtime` after motion integration.
- motion visual QA pass | pending | Run manual browser pass on desktop/mobile for `/`, `/workshops`, `/gpts`, and verify reduced-motion behavior disables enhancement.
- runtime HTTP route smoke automation | completed | Added `scripts/runtime-http-smoke.mjs` plus `npm run verify:runtime` to enforce 200 responses for core static and representative dynamic routes via local `astro preview`.
- gpt placeholder warning dedupe | completed | `loadGPTs()` now logs placeholder CTA warning once per process to reduce duplicate build/check log noise.
- footer/nav join-language parity | completed | Updated footer link label from `Join` to `Contribute` to match header/home contribution terminology.
- workshop detail CTA precedence hardening | completed | Unified `/workshops/[id]` CTA selection so label/href stay in sync (`Replay` -> `Slides` -> `Open details`) and placeholder links cannot produce incorrect labels.
- game embed duplicate listener guard | completed | Added per-node initialization guard in `GameEmbed` inline script and removed unused randomized iframe id to reduce redundant DOM listeners on repeated embeds.
- join funnel contribution reframing | completed | Updated `/join`, homepage route card, header nav, and related route copy to use contribution language while keeping `/join` path compatibility.
- route accent consistency cleanup | completed | Removed hardcoded inline `--scene-accent`/`scene-accent` overrides from index, /gpts, /gpts/[id], /join, and /labs; GPTCard now defaults to route-scoped `var(--scene-accent)` for route-consistent accents.
- homepage route-card visual simplification | completed | Removed decorative route-grid/route-card rail and dot motifs and switched homepage route CTAs to `button--ghost` for cleaner proof-first cards.
- homepage route-card blue-rail removal | completed | Removed `cog-accent-rail` from homepage route cards and added a home-scoped CSS rail kill-switch so the first-page route tiles cannot render the vertical blue line.
- osan premium-quiet upgrade | completed | Added scene depth tokens + proof stack utilities across `/`, `/workshops`, `/visual-classes`, `/gpts`, `/resume`, `/join`, `/labs`, and shared motion pages; resumed motion hooks now include grouped stagger behavior and per-page motion entry controls.
- learn route split | completed | Added dedicated `/visual-classes` page, extracted shared `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`, and made `/workshops` workshops-only.
- astro5 migration completion | completed | Upgraded `astro` to `5.17.2`, upgraded `@astrojs/check` to `0.9.6`, added explicit `src/content.config.ts`, and verified `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- visual-pass for global shell effects | pending | Validate accent and motion behavior at /, /labs, /workshops, /gpts, and /resume on desktop/mobile, including new bubble motif visibility.
- motion parser hardening | completed | Replaced fragile numeric parsing in `src/scripts/osan-motion.ts` with null-safe token parsing and removed `as any` casts while preserving reveal timing behavior.
- global bubble motif rollout | completed | Added centralized route-tinted bubble system across hero shells, first major non-hero content surfaces, and subtle page-frame fallback.
- service-worker deployment verification | pending | Deploy build and run a smoke check on a throttled/offline path.
- lab embed performance optimization | pending | Verify GameEmbed click-to-load behavior and fallback on a real iframe URL.
- manual runtime smoke pass | pending | Automated HTTP 200 checks now run via `npm run verify:runtime`; remaining interactive browser checks are external/inactive link click paths, GameEmbed blocked-iframe fallback, and service worker offline behavior.
- header logo tiny-size verification | pending | Manually validate `/` in fresh browser profile + hard refresh; confirm `.brand-lockup-image` computed width remains in clamp band and no fallback-square logo is shown.
- labs card accent rail removal | completed | Removed Labs listing card pseudo-element rail via `src/styles/pages/labs.css` to eliminate edge line noise and improve heading readability.
- line-review ledger initialization | completed | Added `final_build/LINE_REVIEW_LEDGER.txt` with reviewed status for every file in `src`, `scripts`, `public`, and `docs`, plus explicit dead-code removal entry for `src/components/TwoOptionCTA.astro`.
- release-B dead component cleanup | completed | Removed unreferenced `src/components/TwoOptionCTA.astro` after repository-wide reference check.
- dist integrity automation | completed | Added `scripts/check-dist-integrity.mjs` and npm script `verify:dist` for sitemap parity, internal link integrity, and dynamic route output checks.
- workshop route policy smoke | completed | Verified by build output that `/workshops` detail pages are now generated for all workshop IDs needed by `/visual-classes` slide links.
- production deploy | completed | Pushed commit `0d74eef853a8246af510f87155c556e01a41f5a8` to `main`; workflows `CI` (`22042398300`) and `Deploy Astro site to GitHub Pages` (`22042398323`) completed successfully.
- /join landing refactor | completed | Replaced legacy community catalog /join implementation with the quarter internship landing and added `src/content/data/join_project.json`.
- /join signup CTA activation | completed | Added live signup URL (`https://genmrkt.lovable.app/`) with a primary CTA button and explicit new-tab behavior.
- /join single-cta visual cleanup | completed | Simplified /join hero actions to a single application CTA, removed in-hero `AI-assisted; reviewed by humans; results vary.` copy, and tightened spacing/typography for a cleaner layout.
- labs nav tab label update | completed | Renamed Labs tab label in header to “OSAN GAMES”.
- homepage lab card rename | completed | Reworded homepage labs route card and hero CTA to “OSAN GAMES”.
- footer secondary nav rename | completed | Updated footer /labs label from “Educational Games” to “OSAN GAMES”.
- labs page hero heading rename | completed | Updated `/labs` page title and hero heading to `OSAN GAMES`.
- labs card pill cleanup | completed | Removed Labs listing concept tags and `PLAYABLE` badge in `/labs` cards and tightened Labs-only card rhythm via `src/styles/pages/labs.css`.
- labs hero-card spacing separation | completed | Added Labs-only `32px` (`var(--space-5)`) spacing between `.labs-hero` and first catalog grid block via `.labs-hero + .labs-catalog-grid`.
- modules lessonization pass | completed | Fixed `visualClass` gating for module visibility, added lesson labels and continuity proof chaining, with the `/visual-classes` deck focused on lesson cards only.
- modules slide section removal | completed | Removed the detached `/visual-classes` slide rail/list section and jump chip so Modules displays a single lesson deck focused on proof-first card sequencing.
- learn split QA pass | blocked | Manual browser smoke is pending on `/workshops` and `/visual-classes` for lesson sequence readability at 10% zoom, reduced-motion state, mobile tap target spacing, and route-link discoverability across header/footer/index/more/home with one-accent consistency.
- visual-classes sequence integrity | completed | `/visual-classes` now intentionally renders only the nine provided slide-linked module IDs in explicit Lesson 1-9 order via `VISUAL_CLASS_DECK_SEQUENCE`, with proof copy tuned to progression and continuity.
- visual-classes module scope | completed | `/visual-classes` now renders a modules-only lesson deck (workshop cards are intentionally excluded by default) so the route stays focused on curriculum modules and lesson progression.
- modules data scope hardening | completed | Removed legacy module entries (`adl-browser-only`, `governed-genai-rollout`, `cogsec-playbooks`) from `src/content/data/modules.json` so source data matches the approved `/visual-classes` lesson set.
- learn route tab rename | completed | Renamed the learn destination UI label from "Visual Classes" to "Modules" across header, footer, homepage card, workshops CTA, visual-classes page, and `/more` while keeping `/visual-classes` URL unchanged.
- modules setup hardening | completed | Reworked `/visual-classes` catalog ordering to follow a learning progression and added proof snippets that explain each card’s continuity from the previous lesson.
- visual modules deck refresh | completed | `/visual-classes` now uses strip-style lesson cards with cleaner scan rhythm and explicit lesson sequencing.
- modules plain-language carousel rewrite | completed | Rewrote all nine module lesson titles/descriptions into plain English and replaced the strip with a one-at-a-time arrow carousel (`Previous`/`Next`, keyboard navigation, no loop, full descriptions visible).
- modules slide link enrichment | completed | Added per-module slide links directly in `src/content/data/modules.json` and kept `/visual-classes` CTA precedence as `Slides`-first when configured.
- header logo asset sync | completed | Replaced `/public/icons/osan-logo.png` and `/public/icons/osan-logo@2x.png` with the provided PNG lockup so header now renders the intended raster brand mark from the new asset.
- header logo broken-state fix | completed | Switched header brand to versioned assets (`/icons/osan-logo-v2.png`, `/icons/osan-logo-v2@2x.png`) to avoid cached-path failures, and added a local fallback to `/icons/oscar-cog-brain.svg` when image decode/load fails.
- header logo tiny-size fix | completed | Addressed persistent tiny-lockup behavior by switching header logo sizing to width-driven OSAN-safe clamps (`width` + `aspect-ratio`) and adding explicit fallback-size handling (`brand-lockup-image--fallback`) while keeping route-agnostic lockup behavior.
- header onerror attribute cleanup | completed | Replaced inline `onerror` string in `src/components/Header.astro` with script-bound error handler to preserve fallback behavior and eliminate template analysis hints.
- logo asset dedupe for dist weight | completed | Removed legacy duplicate lockup files (`public/icons/osan-logo.png`, `public/icons/osan-logo@2x.png`) and narrowed service-worker critical-logo matching to canonical `/icons/osan-logo-v2*` assets.
- dependency patch hardening | completed | Upgraded direct deps (`astro` 5.17.3, `motion` 12.34.3), refreshed lockfile, and verified production dependency audit (`npm audit --omit=dev`) is now clean.
- visual-classes data-path simplification | completed | Removed unused workshops load + hybrid catalog branch by making `getVisualClassCatalog()` modules-only and sourcing `/visual-classes` freshness from `modules.json`.
- modules 6-lesson compounding rewrite | completed | Removed `kinetic-proof`, `ghost-machine`, and `policy-gatekeeper`; rewrote remaining lesson titles/descriptions, reset curriculum sequence to six lessons, and aligned homepage Modules counts/copy to modules-only lesson semantics.
- visual-classes hero action cleanup | completed | Removed the two Modules hero action buttons (`Browse lessons`, `Workshops`) from `src/pages/visual-classes.astro` while preserving shared learn hero styles used by `/workshops`.
- visual-classes hero chip cleanup | completed | Removed the `Last updated` hero chip and supporting date-loading logic from `src/pages/visual-classes.astro` so the modules hero remains minimal.
- workshops hero chrome cleanup | completed | Removed the workshops hero `Last updated` chip and `Modules` shortcut button from `src/pages/workshops.astro` while preserving core workshop cards and CTA behavior.
- workshops card noise cleanup | completed | Removed workshop-card date line, proof label bar, and tag chips from `src/pages/workshops.astro` so new workshop entries render only title + proof snippet + CTA.
- footer primary-nav mirror cleanup | completed | Replaced footer mega-link cluster with a top-tab mirror nav (`OSAN GAMES`, `Modules`, `Workshops`, `Contribute`, `Resume`) and set statement text to `One domain per quarter. Open research. Ethical AI. Free skills, donor-sustained.`.
- cross-page staleness cache hardening | completed | Versioned SW registration with `PUBLIC_SW_VERSION`, derived SW cache namespaces from query version, forced `cache: no-store` on navigation fetches, and added dist-level footer consistency assertions.
