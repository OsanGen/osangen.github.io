# Component Spec: `src/components/Footer.astro`

## Purpose
Provide consistent secondary navigation and trust/disclosure text across all routes.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: none (static nav links and footer copy).
- Output: global footer link set and disclosure text.

## State
- Stateless.

## Edge Cases
- Footer naming must remain aligned with primary navigation semantics.
- Contribution route keeps `/join` href for compatibility while using contribution-forward label text.

## Dependencies
- Global typography/spacing styles in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Acceptance Checks
- Footer includes a contribution entry with text `Contribute` and href `/join`.
- Footer does not reintroduce outdated `Join` wording where the funnel is contribution-focused.
