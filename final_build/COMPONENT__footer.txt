# Component Spec: `src/components/Footer.astro`

## Purpose
Provide a clean footer that mirrors the top primary tabs and shows one compact OSAN mission statement.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: current pathname from `Astro.url.pathname` for active-item highlighting.
- Output: footer nav links mirroring header tabs (`OSAN GAMES`, `Modules`, `Workshops`, `Contribute`, `Resume`) plus a single statement line.

## State
- Stateless.

## Edge Cases
- Footer links must stay aligned with header primary-nav labels/hrefs.
- Current route should render `aria-current="page"` in footer without breaking non-footer routes.

## Dependencies
- Global typography/spacing styles in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Dist integrity guardrails in `scripts/check-dist-integrity.mjs` enforce canonical footer nav/statement.

## Acceptance Checks
- Footer nav only includes top-tab routes: `/labs`, `/visual-classes`, `/workshops`, `/join`, `/resume`.
- Footer statement text is exactly: `One domain per quarter. Open research. Ethical AI. Free skills, donor-sustained.`
- Footer does not include legacy secondary link groups (`More`, `Home`, `Book`, `Docs`, etc.).
- Built HTML validation fails if footer statement regresses to `AI-assisted; reviewed by humans; results vary.` on any route.
