Component: `src/lib/content.ts`
Purpose:
- Load and cache content JSON payloads from `src/content/data`.
- Enforce schema validation and small data quality invariants.
- Provide reusable typed accessors for pages and scripts.

Inputs/outputs:
- Loads `profile`, `games`, `modules`, `communities`, `booking`, `workshops`, `posts`, and `gpts`.
- Outputs typed datasets through `load*` functions.
- Exposes `getWorkshopById(id)` for direct workshop resolution on detail views or command-line tooling.

- State:
- Module-scoped `Map<string, Promise<unknown>>` cache keyed by filename.
- Canonical URL check for GPT listing links executed in `loadGPTs`.

Key invariants:
- `loadJsonCached` guarantees one parse+validate pass per file per process.
- `validate:content` currently checks GPT links and proof blocks; other datasets are structurally typed via Zod.

Edge cases:
- Duplicate parsing errors remain cached in Promise map for process lifetime.
- Missing or placeholder links in GPT resource fields can warn without hard-failing (existing behavior).
- `getWorkshopById` returns `null` when id is not found.

Dependencies:
- Zod schemas in `src/lib/schemas.ts`.
- Filesystem reads from `src/content/data`.

Acceptance checks:
- All loaders parse successfully and pass schema validation.
- `loadGPTs` rejects non-canonical listing link values.
- Workshops now include optional `proofLine` and `teachingBullets` as supported schema fields.
