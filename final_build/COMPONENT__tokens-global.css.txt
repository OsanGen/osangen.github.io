# Component Spec: `src/styles/tokens.css` + `src/styles/global.css`

## Purpose
Define and apply CogSec pastel token system with minimal, proof-first surface/stroke/shadow semantics.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: design token values and scene-level accent overrides.
- Outputs:
  - `tokens.css`: canonical variables for WHITE/INK/FOG and 4 Cog accents.
  - `tokens.css`: bubble motif variables (`--bubble-size-*`, offsets, opacities).
  - `global.css`: tokenized component styling, subtle motion, deck/card patterns, and centralized bubble motif rendering.

## State
- Static CSS variable tokens and class-based style definitions.
- No mutable state.
- Bubble motif rendering state is declarative through CSS selectors:
  - shared motif surfaces: `.hero-shell`, `.bubble-surface`
  - automatic non-hero target: first top-level `.card`/`.panel-shell`/`.surface-shell`/`.visual-shell` in `.site-page`

## Edge Cases
- Missing accent overrides should default to `var(--accent)` (COG_BLUE).
- Scene accent tokens should remain stable across cards and navigation states.
- Decorative effects should remain subtle and non-heavy.
- In browsers without `:has`, hero pages may still render motif on first top-level content surface as graceful fallback.
- Reduced-motion mode must disable bubble motif animations.

## Dependencies
- Font imports from `@fontsource`, token references from `tokens.css`.

## Acceptance Checks
- `--accent` resolves to `var(--cog-blue)`.
- `--fog`, `--surface`, `--panel`, `--stroke`, and `--shadow` remain as canonical surfaces.
- Non-token hardcoded colors in token-critical paths are avoided.
- Bubble motif is visible on every route through at least one of:
  - hero surface bubble
  - first non-hero top-level surface bubble
  - low-opacity `.site-page` fallback bubble layer
- Route accent tint drives motif color on each page (no fixed global red override).
- Homepage route cards use minimal proof styling: no route-grid vertical rail, no per-card accent rail, and no floating accent dot on `.route-card`.
- Unused keyframes are removed from global CSS to keep runtime style payload lean and maintainable.
- Mobile breakpoints (`<=900px`, `<=560px`) scale bubble size/offset/dot to avoid overflow.
