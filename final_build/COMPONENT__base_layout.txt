# Component Spec: `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

Purpose:
- Compose global page skeleton with shared metadata, nav/footer shell, and root container.
- Provide a single shared insertion point for global runtime side effects (service worker registration).

Inputs:
- `Props`: `title` (required), `description` (optional)
- Child slot content for page-specific rendering.
- `ServiceWorkerRegister` component import and mount point in the `<body>`.

Outputs:
- Fully formed HTML document scaffold (`<!doctype html>`), global metadata tags, and consistent main/layout structure.

State:
- No internal business logic state.
- Renders static shell and static metadata at build time.

Edge cases:
- Missing description falls back to default portfolio summary.
- Header/footer still render for all routes because layout is shared.

Dependencies:
- `src/styles/global.css` (global tokenized style layer)
- `src/components/Header.astro`, `src/components/Footer.astro`
- `src/components/ServiceWorkerRegister.astro` (performance layer mount).

Acceptance checks:
- Pages render with consistent container and skip link semantics.
- Manifest link and service worker mount are present in all layout-rendered routes.
