Component: `src/components/GPTCard.astro`

Purpose:
- Render a calmer GPT directory card with reduced visual noise.
- Preserve name, outcome, concise tag preview, and one primary CTA.

Inputs:
- `gpt: GPT` from `src/lib/schemas.ts`.
- Optional `revealDelayMs` for list entry animation timing.

Outputs:
- Card with title, single-line outcome (`line-clamp-2`), compact tag list (max 3), and a primary action button.

State:
- No client-side state.

Edge cases:
- Icon is optional and rendered only when available.
- Tags can be empty; empty arrays render compactly.
- Link is opened in a new tab only when URL is external (`https://` or `http://`).

Dependencies:
- `TagList`, `proof` sections, and directory styles in `src/styles/global.css` (`agent-card*`, `.line-clamp-2`, `.panel-shell`).

Acceptance checks:
- No micro rail block exists in card.
- Outcome text is constrained to two lines max.
- CTA exists and points to `gpt.link`.
