# Component: `src/pages/visual-classes.astro`

Purpose:
- Render a dedicated modules catalog composed only of visual-class catalog items:
  - Module-driven visual classes.
  - Non-core workshop-derived visual-class workshops.

Inputs:
- `loadModules()` and `loadWorkshops()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.
- `loadLastModifiedISO('workshops.json')` for last-updated chip text.
- Shared catalog helpers from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero block with learn label, heading, subtitle, and last-updated marker.
- One catalog section (`#visual-class-catalog`) with discoverable proof cards.
- Hero actions include jump-to-catalog and jump-to-slides quick links.
- Lesson deck is rendered as a horizontal, snap-aligned `.learn-module-deck` strip on `/visual-classes`.
- A dedicated `#visual-class-slides` section with clean links to resolved slide/deep links.
- UI label is `Modules` and route remains `/visual-classes`.
- Route now participates in shared motion hooks and premium proof-first visual utilities (`cog-proof-stack`, `cog-accent-rail`, `cog-proof-chip`) to keep rhythm with workshop/listing pages.
- Card rows now omit topic chips; each card includes explicit lesson sequence metadata (`Lesson N`) and proof continuity context.
- Deck cards use explicit `cog-entrance` and grouped motion timing for calm reveal sequencing.

State:
- No client-side state.
- Build-time card derivation and deterministic sorting/filtering.

Edge cases:
- Empty module/workshop inputs render a safe empty-state message.
- Non-displayable visual classes are filtered through `isDisplayableVisualClassModule`.
- Fallback CTAs and proof snippets preserve stable card affordances.
- `#visual-class-slides` can render empty when no resolved slide links exist.

Dependencies:
- `src/lib/content.ts`.
- `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Page contains only visual-class content (no core workshop detail cards).
- `/visual-classes` is discoverable from primary site navigation.
- Empty state is readable and keeps spacing rhythm consistent with learn surfaces.
- Module cards no longer render tag pills; card hierarchy remains proof-first and sequence-oriented.
