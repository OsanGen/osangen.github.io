# Component: `src/pages/visual-classes.astro`

Purpose:
- Render a dedicated modules catalog composed only of visual-class module content:
  - Module-driven visual lessons from `src/content/data/modules.json`.
  - The page intentionally excludes workshop-derived visual-class entries so `/workshops` remains the workshop surface.

Inputs:
- `loadModules()` and `loadWorkshops()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.
- `loadLastModifiedISO('workshops.json')` for last-updated chip text.
- Shared catalog helpers from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero block with learn label, heading, subtitle, and last-updated marker.
- One catalog section (`#visual-class-catalog`) with discoverable proof cards.
- Hero actions include jump-to-catalog quick link and Workshop route link.
- Lesson deck is rendered as a one-at-a-time carousel with explicit `Previous lesson` / `Next lesson` controls and `Lesson X of N` status.
- No dedicated slides rail section is rendered; modules focus on a single proof-first card deck.
- UI label is `Modules` and route remains `/visual-classes`.
- Route now participates in shared motion hooks and proof-first visual utilities (`cog-proof-stack`) while keeping interaction controls low-noise.
- Card rows omit topic chips; each card includes explicit lesson sequence metadata (`Lesson N`), plain-language title, and full non-truncated description text.
- Carousel cards use explicit `cog-entrance` timing and lightweight inline JS for stepwise navigation (`ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `Home`, `End`) with non-loop boundaries.

State:
- Build-time card derivation and deterministic sorting/filtering.
- Client-side ephemeral carousel index state for the active lesson card.

Edge cases:
- Empty module/workshop inputs render a safe empty-state message.
- Non-displayable visual classes are filtered through `isDisplayableVisualClassModule`.
- Primary card actions are slide-oriented for module entries when slide links exist in catalog data or curated module slide overrides, with graceful fallback to module CTA only when no deck link is available.
- `src/content/data/modules.json` is treated as the curated module source and currently contains only the approved lesson sequence entries for `/visual-classes`.
- Arrow controls disable correctly at first/last lesson; carousel does not loop.
Dependencies:
- `src/lib/content.ts`.
- `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Page contains only visual-class content (no core workshop detail cards).
- `/visual-classes` is discoverable from primary site navigation.
- Empty state is readable and keeps spacing rhythm consistent with learn surfaces.
- Module cards no longer render tag pills; card hierarchy remains sequence-oriented and plain-language-first.
- Full lesson descriptions are visible (no truncation).
