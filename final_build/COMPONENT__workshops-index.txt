# Component: `src/pages/workshops.astro` (visual taxonomy surface)

Purpose:
- Provide the workshops-only Learn catalog route:
  - Core workshop cards (with canonical detail pages).
  - Replay + slide quick-link sections for proof-first entry.

Inputs:
- `loadWorkshops()`, `loadLastModifiedISO('workshops.json')`.
- `getCoreWorkshopCatalog`, `getWorkshopReplayLinks`, `getWorkshopSlideLinks` from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero + workshop section with one action button per card.
- Last-updated timestamp for `workshops.json`.
- Replays and slides list sections sourced from core workshop links.

State:
- No client-side state.
- All routing groups are computed at build time in page frontmatter.

Edge cases:
- Workshop entries with missing replay/slides render non-proof route fallback (`/workshops`) or `/workshops/{id}` CTA.
- Replay/slide lists include only valid external links.

Dependencies:
- `CardGrid`, `TagList`.
- `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Only canonical workshops render in this page’s card section (`leanagents-workshop-chatgpt-apps`, `manus-workshop`).
- Replay and slides quick links stay current and open externally.
