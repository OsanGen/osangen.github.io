# Component: `src/pages/workshops.astro` (visual taxonomy surface)

Purpose:
- Provide the workshops-only Learn catalog route:
  - Core workshop cards (with canonical detail pages).
  - Replay + slide quick-link sections for proof-first entry.

Inputs:
- `loadWorkshops()`.
- `getCoreWorkshopCatalog`, `getWorkshopReplayLinks`, `getWorkshopSlideLinks` from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero + workshop section with one action button per card.
- Workshops hero intentionally omits local hero chip/actions for a cleaner top block.
- Replays and slides list sections sourced from core workshop links.
- Workshop cards intentionally render only title, proof snippet text, and single CTA (no date line, no proof-label pill, no tag chips).

State:
- No client-side state.
- All routing groups are computed at build time in page frontmatter.

Edge cases:
- Workshop entries with missing replay/slides render non-proof route fallback (`/workshops`) or `/workshops/{id}` CTA.
- Replay/slide lists include only valid external links.

Dependencies:
- `CardGrid`.
- `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Only canonical workshops render in this page’s card section (`leanagents-workshop-chatgpt-apps`, `manus-workshop`).
- Replay and slides quick links stay current and open externally.
