Component/page: `src/pages/labs.astro`

Purpose:
- Render the `/labs` page as a compact list of playable demos with low-noise visual treatment.
- Emphasize teaching loops and execution actions with cleaner card rhythm.

Inputs:
- `loadGames()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero block in pink-accent scene.
- Card grid of games, each with title, tagline, compact concept tags, and actions:
  - Details, Play, optional Repo.

State:
- No client-side state.
- Build-time index-based animation delay via `cog-entrance`.

Edge cases:
- Missing `repoUrl` shows fallback muted text.
- Index-based reveal offsets scale with item order.

Dependencies:
- `Card`, `CardGrid`, `TagList`, `Badge`.
- `src/styles/global.css` classes: `.catalog-item`, `.catalog-card-stack`, `.cog-entrance`.

Acceptance checks:
- No additional long descriptions on index.
- Cards maintain readable spacing and subtle accent side bar.
- Repo action does not error when URL missing from content.
