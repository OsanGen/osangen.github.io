Component Spec: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`

Purpose:
- Render full workshop detail pages for canonical workshop sessions only.

Inputs:
- `loadWorkshops()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.
- `isCoreWorkshopId()` from `src/lib/workshop-catalog.ts` in `getStaticPaths`.

Outputs:
- Detail rendering for `/workshops/leanagents-workshop-chatgpt-apps` and `/workshops/manus-workshop`.
- Not-found fallback panel for missing or non-core IDs.

State:
- No client-side state; props are passed from static path generation.

Edge cases:
- Non-core workshop IDs are excluded from static path list.
- Missing proof bullets/lines render muted fallback content.
- Missing action links render fallback copy instead of broken anchors.

Dependencies:
- `BaseLayout`, `loadWorkshops`, `Workshop` schema, `isCoreWorkshopId`.

Acceptance checks:
- Only two canonical workshop detail routes are built.
- Non-core routes (e.g. `ghost-machine`) do not have generated detail pages.
