Component Spec: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`

Purpose:
- Render workshop detail pages for all workshop sessions in content, including canonical and catalog-derived sessions.

Inputs:
- `loadWorkshops()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.

Outputs:
- Pre-rendered detail pages for each `Workshop` entry under `/workshops/<id>`.
- Not-found fallback panel for missing workshop IDs.

State:
- No client-side state; props are passed from static path generation.

Edge cases:
- Missing proof bullets/lines render muted fallback content.
- Missing action links render fallback copy instead of broken anchors.
- CTA precedence is deterministic and placeholder-safe: use valid `replayUrl` first, then valid `slidesUrl`, else local detail route.
- CTA label always matches resolved href source (`Replay`, `Slides`, or `Open details`).

Dependencies:
- `BaseLayout`, `loadWorkshops`, `Workshop` schema.

Acceptance checks:
- A detail page is generated for each workshop entry in `workshops.json`.
- Unknown IDs resolve to the not-found fallback panel.
- CTA label cannot report `Replay` when replay URL is unavailable/placeholder.
