# Component Spec: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`

## Purpose
Workshop detail route with full description, proof line, and optional teaching bullets.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: Workshop list from `loadWorkshops`, URL param `id` from `getStaticPaths`.
- Outputs: Detailed page with description, proof section, teaching section, and Replay/Slides action.

## State
- Stateless per-static-path render.
- Loads selected workshop object from build-time props.

## Edge Cases
- Missing workshop id renders fallback not-found panel.
- Missing `proofLine` shows muted fallback sentence.
- Teaching bullets may be absent and render muted fallback copy.
- `audienceLine` is rendered when present.

## Dependencies
- `BaseLayout`, `loadWorkshops`, `Workshop` schema.

## Acceptance Checks
- Proof content is disclosed via `<details>` blocks.
- Content remains short and scannable by default.
