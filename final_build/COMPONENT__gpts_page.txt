Component/page: `src/pages/gpts.astro`

Purpose:
- Provide a calm, low-noise directory of Lean Agents.
- Keep layout minimal and add subtle per-item pacing/accent variation.

Inputs:
- `loadGPTs()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.

Outputs:
- Hero with concise title and deck.
- `gpts-grid` card set where each `GPTCard` receives:
  - `revealDelayMs` for staggered entrance.
- No custom scene accent overrides; cards inherit `--scene-accent` from `/gpts` route token for one-accent consistency.
- CTA strip for navigation to related routes, including contribution opportunities.

State:
- No interactive state; render-time list mapping.

Edge cases:
- Empty dataset would render an empty grid with no crash path change.
- External links in CTA remain unchanged from existing token semantics.

Dependencies:
- `GPTCard.astro` and `src/styles/global.css` (`.gpts-grid`, `.cog-entrance`).

Acceptance checks:
- One card row has minimal metadata with one primary “Open” style CTA per item.
- No busy micro rails or decorative rails remain in cards.
- Accent follows route token from `BaseLayout` without hardcoded overrides.
