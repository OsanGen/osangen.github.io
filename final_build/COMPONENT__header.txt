Component: `src/components/Header.astro`

Purpose:
- Keep top-level navigation minimal and one-line on common widths.
- Surface the external `Book` action as a primary-style CTA rather than a nav link.

Inputs:
- Runtime `Astro.url.pathname` for active link state.

Outputs:
- Header markup with brand lockup, four short nav labels, and a right-side CTA button to Calendly.

State:
- No mutable state; purely render-time nav map and current path detection.

Edge cases:
- Active-state logic treats `/` as exact match and route prefixes for other sections.
- External CTA opens in a new tab and preserves `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

Dependencies:
- `src/styles/global.css` classes: `.site-header`, `.site-nav`, `.header-right`, `.nav-link`, `.nav-cta`.
- Shared route table (`/labs`, `/workshops`, `/join`, `/resume`).

Acceptance checks:
- Primary nav shows only: Labs, Learn, Join, Resume.
- Book appears as a button on the right side.
- Page path `/` and section routes highlight expected nav item.
