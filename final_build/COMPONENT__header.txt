# Component Spec: `src/components/Header.astro`

## Purpose
Primary site nav with explicit learn-surface discoverability and a prominent Book CTA as a button.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: current pathname from `Astro.url.pathname`.
- Output: Header with explicit nav links for `OSAN GAMES`, `Visual Classes`, `Workshops`, `Contribute`, and `Resume` plus a right-side `Book` button.

## State
- Stateless, path-based current-item highlighting.

## Edge Cases
- Root path normalization (`/` vs `/foo/`).
- External Calendly CTA always opens a new tab safely.
 - Discoverability for learn routes is explicit with separate `Visual Classes` and `Workshops` links.

## Dependencies
- `header` styles in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Acceptance Checks
- Header includes explicit `Visual Classes` and `Workshops` links.
- Existing active state and CTA behavior remain intact.
- Book action is button-like on the right and not a nav link.
