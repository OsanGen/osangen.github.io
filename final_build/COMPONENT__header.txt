# Component Spec: `src/components/Header.astro`

## Purpose
Primary site nav with reduced items and a prominent Book CTA as a button.

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: current pathname from `Astro.url.pathname`.
- Output: Header with nav links and a right-side `Book` button.

## State
- Stateless, path-based current-item highlighting.

## Edge Cases
- Root path normalization (`/` vs `/foo/`).
- External Calendly CTA always opens a new tab safely.

## Dependencies
- `header` styles in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Acceptance Checks
- Four concise nav labels: OSAN GAMES, Learn, Contribute, Resume.
- Book action is button-like on the right and not a nav link.
