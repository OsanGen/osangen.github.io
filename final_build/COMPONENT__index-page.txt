# Component: `src/pages/index.astro`

Purpose:
- Turn the homepage into a compact router with minimal prose and three clear entry points.

Inputs:
- `loadGames`, `loadModules`, and `loadWorkshops` from content loader.

Outputs:
- Hero shell with short headline, one-line lede, two top CTAs (OSAN Games, Book).
- Three route cards (`OSAN GAMES`, `Learn`, `Contribute`) with concise subtitle + CTA.
- Page and hero accents follow `/` route token from `BaseLayout` instead of inline overrides.

State:
- Stateless render.

Edge cases:
- Pluralization handles singular/plural and zero values.
- Contribution card copy remains stable because it is no longer coupled to communities counts.

Dependencies:
- `Card` and `CardGrid` layout components.
- Tokens and scene styles in `src/styles/global.css` (`.hero-shell`, `.route-grid`, `.route-card`).

Acceptance checks:
- Multi-section catalog blocks are not used on homepage.
- Above-fold consists of hero + three route cards only.
- H1, subtitle, and CTA copy remain concise.
- Route cards use cleaner visual treatment without decorative route rails/dots.
