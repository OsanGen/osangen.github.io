# Component Spec: `src/pages/index.astro`

## Purpose
Landing router that reduces cognitive load by presenting one clear path section (hero + 3 route cards).

## Inputs / Outputs
- Inputs: `games`, `modules`, `workshops`, `communities` loaded from content loaders.
- Output: Rendered home page with route cards for Labs / Learn / Join.

## State
- Stateless render.
- No local mutable state.

## Edge Cases
- Pluralization must remain readable at 1 item and >1 items.
- Keeps hero text under the requested brevity thresholds.

## Dependencies
- `BaseLayout`, `Card`, `CardGrid`, `loadGames`, `loadModules`, `loadWorkshops`, `loadCommunities`.

## Acceptance Checks
- Hero has <=1 headline sentence and <=1 lede line.
- Exactly 3 route cards rendered.
- No removed sections like “Featured open resources” or LinkedIn source-of-truth block appear on this page.
