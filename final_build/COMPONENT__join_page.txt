# Component/page: `src/pages/join.astro`

Purpose:
- Render `/join` as a focused open-source contribution landing for GENMRKT.
- Keep one clear external application path with compact scope and impact context.

Inputs:
- `../content/data/join_project.json` for all user-facing copy and CTA values.
- `src/lib/link-utils.ts` for link sanitization and placeholder/unavailable detection.

Outputs:
- Hero with contribution-focused eyebrow, title, and lede from content JSON.
- One external CTA button only (`Apply to contribute`) when link is valid.
- One scope panel with up to six contribution chips and one-line impact statement.
- Hero and decorative accents follow route-level `--page-accent` so `/join` does not carry inline overrides.

State:
- No client-side state.
- Build-time derivations only: `hasPrimaryCta`, `visibleChips`.

Edge cases:
- Missing/placeholder CTA URL suppresses button rendering and shows fallback text.
- CTA keeps external-link safety attributes and explicit new-tab aria label.
- Scope chips are capped to six entries for stable panel density.

Dependencies:
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- `src/lib/link-utils.ts`
- `src/content/data/join_project.json`
- Shared shell styles in `src/styles/global.css`

Acceptance checks:
- `/join` renders two-column desktop and stacked mobile layout.
- Route copy frames this as an open-source contribution opportunity, not a community directory.
- CTA uses `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- CTA is hidden for invalid/unavailable/placeholder links.
