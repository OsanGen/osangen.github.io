# Component/page: `src/pages/join.astro`

Purpose:
- Render the GENMRKT internship landing as a minimal, two-column page focused on one project scope.
- Replace legacy community catalog content with a compact, single-purpose recruiting surface.

Inputs:
- `../content/data/join_project.json` for all visible copy and link strings.
- `src/lib/link-utils.ts` helpers for link sanitization and placeholder detection.

Outputs:
- Primary CTA stack with:
  - one external application button only (`Sign up`)
- One focused scope panel containing one-line chips and one-line impact statement.
- No in-hero fine-print copy.

State:
- No client-side state.
- All derivation is build-time/templating only (`hasPrimaryCta`, `visibleChips`).

Edge cases:
- Placeholder application URL disables primary CTA action and shows explicit setup text.
- Primary CTA preserves 44px+ click target minimum.
- Scope chips are capped by display logic to six entries.

Dependencies:
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- `src/lib/link-utils.ts`
- `src/content/data/join_project.json`
- Site-level shell/bubble styles from `src/styles/global.css`.

Acceptance checks:
- Route `/join` must render the quarter landing layout (two columns on desktop, stacked on mobile).
- Primary CTA uses `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Primary CTA has explicit accessibility label indicating new-tab behavior.
- Primary CTA is not rendered when `ctaHref` is missing/invalid.
- In-hero line `AI-assisted; reviewed by humans; results vary.` is not rendered on `/join`.
- No community catalog dependency (`loadCommunities`) remains in this page.
