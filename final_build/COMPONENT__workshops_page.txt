Component/page: `src/pages/workshops.astro`

Purpose:
- Render a compact learning index composed of two sections: Visual classes and Workshops.
- Keep the index short and scannable, with no long teaching blocks.

Inputs:
- `loadModules()`, `loadWorkshops()`, `loadLastModifiedISO('workshops.json')` from `src/lib/content.ts`.

Outputs:
- Intro with last updated date.
- `Visual classes` section: card grid with title + `time · level` + up to 3 tags + one CTA.
- `Workshops` section: card grid with title + date + up to 3 tags + one CTA to `/workshops/{id}`.

State:
- No client-side state.
- Build-time derived groups:
  - `visualClasses` from modules where `visualClass` is truthy.
  - `workshopCards` from workshop list (currently limited for compactness).

Edge cases:
- Empty sections render concise fallback copy.
- Missing `loadLastModifiedISO` date shows `Not available`.
- If no workshop links are present, cards are hidden/empty due dataset control.

Dependencies:
- `Card`, `CardGrid`, `TagList` components.
- `/workshops/{id}` detail route.
- `src/styles/global.css` (`catalog-item`, `.cog-entrance`, `--scene-accent`) for accent-led, lower-noise cards.

Acceptance checks:
- No in-page long teaching prose or “How this teaches” sections.
- Two card regions only.
- One CTA per card, with workshops deep-linking to detail pages.
