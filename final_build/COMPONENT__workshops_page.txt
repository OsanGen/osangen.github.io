# Component/page: `src/pages/workshops.astro`

Purpose:
- Render workshops-only listing:
  - Hero + quick anchors for list entry points.
  - Canonical core workshops (2 canonical workshop detail routes).
- Keep behavior and CTAs identical to previous workshop card logic (Replay/Slides/Open details).
- Keep output concise with stable CTA behavior and no broken detail route assumptions.

Inputs:
- `loadWorkshops()` from `src/lib/content.ts`.
- Shared learn helpers from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Outputs:
- Intro hero with eyebrow/title/subtitle only (no last-updated chip or hero action buttons).
- `Workshops` section with core-workshop cards, sorted newest first.
- Replays and slides quick-link sections sourced from core workshop CTAs.
- Motion and visual hierarchy utilities (`cog-proof-stack`, `cog-accent-rail`, `cog-proof-chip`) are applied to hero/catalog/sections to match the premium-quiet pattern.

State:
- No client-side state.
- Build-time derivations:
  - `splitWorkshops(workshops)` for canonical workshop filtering.
  - Shared card/link helpers from `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Edge cases:
- Missing dates/labels fall back to safe route text and/or `/workshops` cta.
- Duplicate or empty workshop/module fields do not crash card rendering.
- Module helper blocks display for configured non-visual-class modules.

Dependencies:
- `CardGrid`, `TagList`.
- `src/lib/content.ts`, `src/lib/learn-pages.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Only core workshop detail links are generated from `coreWorkshops`.
- Replays/Slides lists include only workshops with valid external CTAs.
- `/workshops/{id}` details route remains reachable for `coreWorkshops`.
