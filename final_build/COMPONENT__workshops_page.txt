Component/page: `src/pages/workshops.astro`
Purpose:
- Render a compact `/workshops` learning index with two sections: visual classes and workshop list.
- Keep each card minimal with title + one-line metadata + one primary CTA.

Inputs/outputs:
- Loads `workshops` and `modules` via `loadWorkshops` and `loadModules`.
- Reads optional `updated` timestamp via `loadLastModifiedISO('workshops.json')`.
- Outputs the rendered index UI and links to detail routes at `/workshops/{id}`.

State:
- No client state; derived values at build time.
- Derived groups: `visualClasses`, `workshopCards`.

Edge cases:
- Empty visual classes and empty workshop lists render concise fallback text.
- Missing or stale workshop timestamps degrade to `Not available` without breaking render.

Dependencies:
- `TagList` for compact tag chips.
- `Card`, `CardGrid` for layout.
- Detail route: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`.

Acceptance checks:
- Exactly two card regions on the index: visual classes and workshops.
- No inline long teaching-guide sections are present on index.
- Each workshop card has one CTA to open its detail route.

Component/page: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`
Purpose:
- Render detailed workshop content on a dedicated route using the workshop data model.
- Keep long/technical content inside a `<details>` disclosure while preserving quick skim at top.

Inputs/outputs:
- Static route generation from `getStaticPaths` over `loadWorkshops()`.
- Input prop: `{ workshop }` from params.
- Outputs title, date, description, optional proof line, optional teaching bullets, primary action CTA, and back link.

State:
- No local client state; all content is server-rendered/static by Astro.

Edge cases:
- Missing or malformed workshop record renders a short not-found panel.
- Optional fields render only when present (`proofLine`, `teachingBullets`).
- `actionHref` uses `replayUrl` when present, otherwise falls back to `slidesUrl`.

Dependencies:
- Detail route is in the same content model flow as `src/pages/workshops.astro`.
- Workshop types from `src/lib/schemas.ts` and `loadWorkshops`.

Acceptance checks:
- `/workshops/{id}` resolves for each item in `workshops.json`.
- Long text is nested in a `<details open>` block by default.
- No duplicate teaching bullet content remains on `/workshops` index.

Component/page: `src/pages/workshops/[id].astro`
Purpose:
- Render detailed workshop content from data model fields.
- Show description, optional proof line, and optional teaching bullets.
- Keep expanded teaching context in `<details open>` for readability control.

Inputs/outputs:
- Static paths generated from `loadWorkshops`.
- Inputs: `id` route param and typed `Workshop` payload in Astro props.
- Outputs: description panel, proof/teaching detail panel, action CTA, and back link.

State:
- No client state.

Edge cases:
- Missing `proofLine` or `teachingBullets` renders only the fields available.
- Missing workshop record renders a small not-found panel.

Dependencies:
- Workshop schema type plus content loader in `src/lib/schemas.ts` and `src/lib/content.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- Detail page includes full description.
- Long content is wrapped in a default-open `details` block.
- A missing optional CTA target does not block rendering.
