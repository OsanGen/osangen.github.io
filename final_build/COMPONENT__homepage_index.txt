Component: `src/pages/index.astro`

Purpose:
- Render the homepage route chips and summary stats.

Inputs:
- `loadGames()`, `loadModules()`, `loadWorkshops()`, `loadCommunities()`.
- `splitWorkshops()` and `isDisplayableVisualClassModule()` for workshop taxonomy-aware counts.

Outputs:
- Route cards (`Labs`, `Learn`, `Join`) with updated counts.
- Hero summary line showing visual-class count derived from module classes + visual-class workshops.

State:
- No client-side state.

Edge cases:
- `learn` card now reflects only canonical workshops (`splitWorkshops` output).
- Visual-class summary includes both module visual classes and visual-class workshop-derived items.

Dependencies:
- `Card`, `CardGrid`, `sanitizeLink`, `src/lib/workshop-catalog.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- `Learn` subtitle equals count of canonical workshop routes (2).
- Visual class summary remains in sync with taxonomy split used on `/workshops`.
