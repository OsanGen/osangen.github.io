Component: `src/pages/index.astro`

Purpose:
- Turn the homepage into a compact router with minimal prose and three clear entry points.

Inputs:
- `loadGames`, `loadModules`, `loadWorkshops`, and `loadCommunities`.

Outputs:
- Hero shell with short headline, one-line lede, two top CTAs (Labs, Book).
- Three route cards (`Labs`, `Learn`, `Join`) each with one count subtitle and one CTA.

State:
- No client state.

Edge cases:
- Pluralization for counts handles singular/plural and zero values.
- Communities route fallback if there are no entries still renders valid subtitles (`0 communities`).

Dependencies:
- `Card` and `CardGrid` layout components.
- Tokens and scene styles in `src/styles/global.css` (`.hero-shell`, `.route-grid`, `.route-card`).

Acceptance checks:
- Multi-section catalog/featured blocks removed from homepage.
- Above-fold consists of hero + three route cards only.
- H1, subtitle, and CTA count remain concise.
