Component: `src/pages/index.astro`

Purpose:
- Render the homepage as a four-route decision surface with concise proof-first framing.

Inputs:
- `loadGames()`, `loadModules()`, `loadWorkshops()`.
- `splitWorkshops()` and `isDisplayableVisualClassModule()` for route counts, with modules metric now modules-only.

Outputs:
- Route cards (`OSAN GAMES`, `Workshops`, `Modules`, `Contribute`) with concise labels and direct actions.
- Hero summary line showing modules lesson count derived from displayable module entries only.
- Contribute route card copy reflects teaching-path positioning (`Upskill to teach AI in communities`).

State:
- No client-side state.

Edge cases:
- `learn` card now reflects only canonical workshops (`splitWorkshops` output).
- Modules summary excludes workshop-derived items and uses lesson terminology (`lesson(s)`).
- Contribution route card remains stable even when communities dataset changes (no card coupling to `communities.length`).

Dependencies:
- `Card`, `CardGrid`, `sanitizeLink`, `src/lib/workshop-catalog.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- `Workshops` subtitle equals count of canonical workshop routes.
- `Contribute` card subtitle is teaching-path framing (`Upskill to teach AI in communities`).
- Route-card CTA styling uses `button--ghost` for lower visual noise.
- Modules summary remains in sync with `/visual-classes` modules-only curriculum.
