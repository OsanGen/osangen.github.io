Component: `src/pages/index.astro`

Purpose:
- Render the homepage as a four-route decision surface with concise proof-first framing.

Inputs:
- `loadGames()`, `loadModules()`, `loadWorkshops()`.
- `splitWorkshops()` and `isDisplayableVisualClassModule()` for workshop taxonomy-aware counts.

Outputs:
- Route cards (`OSAN GAMES`, `Workshops`, `Visual Classes`, `Contribute`) with concise labels and direct actions.
- Hero summary line showing visual-class count derived from module classes + visual-class workshops.

State:
- No client-side state.

Edge cases:
- `learn` card now reflects only canonical workshops (`splitWorkshops` output).
- Visual-class summary includes both module visual classes and visual-class workshop-derived items.
- Contribution route card remains stable even when communities dataset changes (no card coupling to `communities.length`).

Dependencies:
- `Card`, `CardGrid`, `sanitizeLink`, `src/lib/workshop-catalog.ts`.

Acceptance checks:
- `Workshops` subtitle equals count of canonical workshop routes.
- `Contribute` card subtitle is static contribution framing (`Open-source contribution`).
- Route-card CTA styling uses `button--ghost` for lower visual noise.
- Visual class summary remains in sync with taxonomy split used on `/visual-classes` and `/workshops`.
