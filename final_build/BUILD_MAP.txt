Website architecture map:
- Pages layer (`src/pages/*.astro`) reads JSON from content loader and renders routes.
  - Core user routes: `/`, `/gpts`, `/gpts/[id]`, `/labs`, `/labs/[gameId]`, `/workshops`, `/workshops/[id]`, `/posts`, `/join`, `/book`, `/about`, `/resume`, `/more`, `/docs`, `/code-of-conduct`.
- Shared layout (`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`) adds global header/footer, metadata, and style imports.
- Header (`src/components/Header.astro`) owns the primary nav simplification and external Book CTA.
- Components provide reusable UI cards, grids, ctas, and specialized renderers (`GameEmbed`, `GPTCard`, etc.) and are imported by pages.
- Content source is JSON under `src/content/data` and loaded through `src/lib/content.ts` (with `getWorkshopById` helper for detail lookups).
- Schema guardrails live in `src/lib/schemas.ts` and are executed in loader+validator.
- Build/validation pipeline runs `npm run lint` (`astro check`), `npm run validate:content`, and `npm run build`.
- Remaining pipeline risk: sitemap generation does not currently assert dynamic `[id]` routes for SEO parity with full route set.
- CI and maintenance scripts: `scripts/validate-content.ts`, `scripts/import_linkedin_posts.ts`, `scripts/import_linkedin_workshops.ts`, `scripts/sync-github-icons.mjs`.
